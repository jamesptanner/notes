two handed pass to other player. Once passed join the back of the queue you passed to.

### 1 handed passes
Same setup as before. 

Place ball in dominant hand, ball held at head height. after throwing the ball, your arm should be pointing at target. (5 minutes) (take a step back halfway through)

Increase distance. Addition of rotation of top of body to throw. Start with dom foot behind weak foot. ball in line with sholder.
Bring ball through straight line to where you plan to release the, while the top of your body is rotating to add extra force to the throw. (10 minutes) (take a step back halfway through)

### Passing with Weaker hand
Reset back to slightly closer.

Passing with the weaker hand is exactly the same as passing with the dominant. Passing with this hand is benifitial when you need to pass to a player on your weaker side. 

Same steps as previous but reveresed. 
* Weaker foot behind. Ball in weaker hand. - held at sholder height
