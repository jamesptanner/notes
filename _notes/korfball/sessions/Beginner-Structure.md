# Division Structure

## Aim
Basics of Korfball game structure.

## Session length 
2 Hrs

## Requirements
1 Post per 8-12 players.

## Plan
This session is the first to cover the aspects of korfball that make it different from other sports. 

What we will cover is the basic formation of korfball. 4-0. Working the ball around and moving into collect.


## Skills to cover

* Keeping the 4-0 Structure. 
* Moving into collect

### 4-0 Structure

We will start with moving the ball around the post. Setup 4 players spread evenly around the post. 
As the ball is passed around slowly around the players. The player opposite the player with the ball will walk towards towards the post while they are catching the ball, and walk back when their opposite passes on. Repeat a few times one way, and then go the other way around.
</br>Remember to swap players around

Next We change the walk backwards to veering off to the side towards the player that will be passing to you. Bit faster than before. Demonstraiting the momvement that happens around the korf.
Then add someone running into the post with their arm up, and the player opposite them will shoot. This is also known as 3-1

Final level is adding the defenders role into the formation. 
The defender will follow what their player is doing putting pressure onto the player.
