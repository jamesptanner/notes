# Defence

## Aim
teaching the basics of defense in korfball.

## Session length 
2 Hrs

## Requirements
1 post per 12 people.

## Plan
go over the basics of defense in korfball. focusing mainly on rebound and getting a good position.

## Skills to cover

* keeping a strong rebound defense position. 
* holding the collect position as the defense.
* judging distance while defending.


### keeping strong rebound position.
get into pairs line up one side of the hall.

player facing forward tries to get around their partner. 80% effort from that player. other player is to prent the player getting past. mathching movements of the player as they work to the opposite side of the hall. no holding off. The goal is not for the attakers to just run pass. 50% effort to start with, increase if appropriate.

### Holding collect position as defence
Move to around the post. Repeat passing drill from last week, but this time have the defence keep their postitions against the player. One attacker moves into collect, the defender try to hold the best position in collect

#### relevent rule: 

6.11 To hinder an opponent excessively

Whenever a player hinders an opponent and:

* knocks, takes or runs the ball out of his hands;
* limits the free use of his body by blocking his arm instead of the ball;
* hits the throwing arm or beats the ball, i.e. the hindering arm or hand must not move quickly towards the ball in such a way that contact takes place with the ball before it has left the opponentâ€™s hands.

For this rule to be violated the opponent must have reasonable control of the ball by holding it with one or two hands or letting the ball rest on the palms on his hands or in his fingers.
It is allowed to hinder an opponent in throwing of the ball in the desired direction by using actions that result in the ball being thrown against his hand or arm.

No infringement occurs when:

* the hindering arm and hand are brought in the path of the throwing arm in an attempt to intercept the ball which is touched after it has already left the hand of the thrower;
* the contact with the ball is made while it is still on the hand of the thrower but the hindering arm or hand is at rest.

Unexpected movements by an opponent will often cause a restriction in a player's freedom of movement. Such cases will not be punished, provided immediate action is taken by the opponent to restore the player's freedom of movement.

If there is only slight contact and the pass is not affected unfavourably, then the referee should allow to play on.


Strong action must be taken when the hindering degenerates into "hitting" even when the throw does not fail (except when a scoring chance results from the throw: the referee will then await the result and warn the offending player later).
