## Aim
Introduce new potential players to korfball

## Session length 
2 Hrs

## Requirements

* Full hall
* 4/5 posts

This is a more free form session, with no focus on any particular aspect but covering alot of the aspects of the sport. 

Returner used to run a station. any left distrubuted between groups.
split all into groups. Rotate around all stations

## Skills to cover

* Short range shots (1m)
* Mid range shots (2m)
* Running in shots
* penalties
* Passing 

### Short shots
setup 1m away from front of post. feet sholder width apart facing post. hands on ball forming the 'W', with ball held in front of chest.

Smooth extension of arms up through the ball. releasing at the top. Finish with arm fully extended and hands together

<span style="color:orange">
Explain open arms widens the inaccuracy of the shot. As well as if the posture of the shot is not balanced.
</span>


### Medium shots
Same as setting up for the short shot except 3/4m away from post. Include bending of the legs to increase the distance.

### Running in shots
One of the more advance movement that new players probably wont get first time.

Setup with a feed out front of the post off to the side. Explain their role in the drill.

setup the runner out several paces from the feed. 

start the run, when a couple paces from the shot call for the ball.

Hands under the ball, and lift straight up while running. Ball should land where you are standing if you were not moving.

### Penalties
Setup 2.5 meters from post

Rock backwards and forwards. lift ball from underneath. ball should just go over the top of the korf.
baby on the shelf.

take 2/3 shots before rotating.

### Passing

Use Half court.

Split group into two  (try and keep them balanced) teams.

Work on passing between members of team from one end of badmington court to the other. 
 
basic korf rules for playing, no taking out of hands 
Every few minutes extend ruleset. eg

* minimum number of passes
* pass to every player before making it to the other side.
