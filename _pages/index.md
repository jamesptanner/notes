# Welcome! 🌱

I plan on using this site to keep track of personal projects and ideas.

Im also going to be using to organise my ideas for [[korfball|korfball training sessions]]. ⛹️‍♂️

This site is based off a digital garden template, which is free, open-source, and [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).

Any contributions to the notes are welcome and can be provided via PR submissions to the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/jamesptanner/notes)
