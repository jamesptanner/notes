# Welcome! 🌱

I plan on using this site to keep track of personal projects and ideas.

Im also going to be using to organise my ideas for [[korfball|korfball training sessions]]. ⛹️‍♂️

This digital garden template is free, open-source, and [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).

The easiest way to get started is to read this [step-by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).
