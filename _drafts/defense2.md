plan:

looking at defence

warmup
mirror game

follow with 1 on 1 defence across hall
- side on
- on balls of feet
- small steps

Rebound defence

Aim is for the defenders to control the space under the post.

Setup 4-0.  attackers work ball around. defenders keeping that positiion between the player and the post. 

If the attacker thinks they are free take a shot - dont worry about the collect for now.

once 3 shots taken then attacker/defenders switch.

# 

Front defence.

Marking that ball line (between the player and the ball)

- stand just off the ball line
- facing so that you can see both players
- again small movements

side to side runs. 

groups of 4/5, triangle game.




---


if we have cones start with cone game 

- keep body wide
- keep contact with your opponent
- control of the space.

move to contorlling under the post

join groups up and place onto posts.

start with two players under the post A/D. 

player compete to control
