posted: 
* one half of a two court sports hall with a solid curtain spliting them that reduces the amount of noise between the halls. its currently fine for the number of players we have but we have had points in the past where if we are runing a game it can have alot of people off to the side. Also when there was a workout class in the next hall the bass wouldnt get as blocked making presenting hard at times.

## Comming Plan

one on one
get players to be better at scoring when defended.

quick refresh on veering/ runners. 
bring in a Feed and Defender to the drill, with a set task for what they are doing, 
starting with driving the D back towards to the F and then veer of getting D to 'slow' their reaction to the veer.
Repeat with the defender overcommiting and A going into a runner.
Join them together letting D choose how they are going to make the mistake and the A has to choose which shot to go for.
Turn into timed shooting game afterwards for a bit of competition.
