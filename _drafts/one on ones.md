## Requirements
how to provide the best assistance possileble to a defended attacker

## KTP
keeping the defener engaged
stringing movement ogether without breaks
use that change in speed and direction

we want to loook or getting that spacc#e away from your defender so we are able to put up good shots

this ivolves being able to rea d your efender and and making the a deciison that allows you to exploit what tthey believe that you are going to do.

to start wiht we will do some simple veering shot
we will have a feed ou at the side, a attacker that will recieve thee ball, and a defender wo whill be easkly ront defending.

have the feed pass to the attacker, atacker will pass pack and immediately run towards the feed. once the reach a step out from the halfway point hey will, hop onto their outside foot and turn so they are facing the post, while the feedd is passing the ball back, aand land with the ball , ready to take the shot. as they are taking that shot ehy will bring their center  of mass down and over heir back foot, before springing up and taking the shot, remembering o keep that back straigh and ending with the hands up in the air.

defeenders will be slightly of the ball line simulating nott quite having that front defence position.
rotation: attacker > feed > defence.

3 loops, go over what went well and could go better.

this time we wll do the same setup again but the efender will provide a better defence o the ball line so the attacker will drie the defender towards the feed, plant their foot and driev awayfrom the feed, at a angle th will cause the defender to turn, this is so that the feed will hae to oppertunity to pass the ball without the ddeffender knowing, over the top, atttaker bringing theselve to a balanced position and taking the shot.

rotation: attacker > feed > defence.

3 loops, go over what went well and could go better.
what can we do if the defender makes it back into a deefened position?

this time we will have the defender take more of a close rebound postition. 
same dirll again, but this time the defender will over commit on the veer out, he attacker will pass back to the feed, and go for a running in shot. 
rotation: attacker > feed > defence.

finallly we will go into making the decisions on the fly. 
same setup as before. the dfender is going to choose how they defend, fd bad fd well or rebound. attacker and the feed need to read the defender and make the decision on how they are going to respond.

do 3 attacks and then rotate.

conclusion

go overthe 3 points

keeping the defener engaged
stringing movement ogether without breaks
use that change in speed and direction.
